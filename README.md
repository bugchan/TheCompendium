# TheCompendium

Welcome to the Physics Compendium!

This LaTeX project was originally created as study guide for the Physics GRE. 
It can be used as a tool for memorization, review, and reference.
Please consider adding to it, especially if something strikes you as wrong or unclear.

Would like to...
 * Propagate macros throughout 
 * Improve formatting
 * Improve macros?
 * Add physics! (For quals/comps!)
